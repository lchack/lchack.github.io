Hello and welcome to lchack.org, the home of the Lewis & Clark Hacker Club! We've begun putting on events for the Spring 2015 semester, the first two of which have already occurred.

Here are the details:
Hack Night is an opportuntity for creators and visionaries in the Lewis & Clark community to come together to work on projects and ideas.

We kicked off our first meeting on February 3rd, with almost 30 students in attendance. The topic was the LC Startup Competition, an opportunity for students to build projects to benefit the Lewis & Clark community. In that first meeting, thirteen people pitched ideas - and after a selection process, four stood standing. We formed groups, ate pizza, and talked about future plans.

The second Hack Night meeting was on February 17th, and was mostly comprised of repeat attendees from the first meeting, with a few new faces thrown in. The night opened with a presentation on Design Thinking from gecko researcher, Biology professor, and future Entrepreneurship Center department head Kellar Autumn. After Kellar, [Quinn](http://qrohlf.com) gave a quick lightning talk on web development (synposis: learn it). We had two new pitches, some repeat pitches for the new folks, and a lot of pizza.

Moving forward, our goal remains the same: we want to work on your project ideas (and we want you to work on them)!
We're thinking about shifting towards a weekly meeting time, probably with two different days so that more people can attend.
