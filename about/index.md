The Lewis & Clark Hacker Club (LChack) was started in 2014 with the goal of creating a community of makers and doers.

In the Spring semester of 2015, we started Hack Night, an opportunity for Lewis & Clark students of all backgrounds to come together and work on projects.

As part of Hack Night, LChack is holding a Startup Competition, with a prize of $250 (max $50 per team member) to be distributed among the members of the winning team.
